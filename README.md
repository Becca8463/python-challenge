# python-challenge
In this challenge I was asked to create a python script to analyze the the records in the financial dataset for PYBANK.I need to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. Next I am tasked to create another python script to help calculate votes in an election. I am needing to calculate The total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes,the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. This second task is called PYPOLL. For both of these tasks I have printed the analysis to the terminal in vs code and exported a text file with the results.
